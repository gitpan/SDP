SDP - Simplified Database Platform

SDP is part of what will later be a suite of utilities to make database
access even less intensive of a process than it is today.  Currently it
provides automatic database connectivity on use and returning (hopefully)
useful data structures rather than object handles.  It aims to make the
database work with your data the way you work, not the other way around.
